Service-based businesses (consulting, freelancing) typically require less ($200-500), while product-based businesses need more ($1,000-3,000). The key is starting lean and reinvesting profits rather than borrowing large amounts. Focus your initial budget on: domain and hosting ($100-200), basic tools and software ($200-500), initial marketing ($300-800), and emergency fund for unexpected expenses ($200-500). Avoid expensive "business opportunities" that promise instant success.\n\n`;
    
    faqs += `### What's the realistic timeline to replace a full-time income online?\n\n`;
    faqs += `Most successful online entrepreneurs take 12-24 months to replace a full-time income, with part-time income (25-50% replacement) typically achievable in 6-12 months. However, this assumes 20+ hours weekly commitment and following proven strategies. The timeline varies by: chosen business model (services are faster than products), existing skills and experience, available time investment, market conditions, and quality of execution. About 20% of people achieve meaningful income within 6 months, while 60% either quit or fail to generate significant revenue. Success requires treating it as a real business, not a hobby.\n\n`;

    faqs += `Only quit your job after your online income consistently exceeds 75% of your current salary for at least 3-6 months. The transition should be strategic: start part-time while employed, build emergency fund (6+ months expenses), achieve consistent monthly revenue, have systems that can run with reduced time investment, and ensure growth trajectory supports your financial needs. Many successful entrepreneurs maintain employment until their online business generates 100-150% of their current income. The financial and psychological pressure of going full-time too early often leads to poor decision-making and business failure.\n\n`;
    
    faqs += `### What are the biggest mistakes that cause online businesses to fail?\n\n`;
    faqs += `The top failure factors are: 1) No market validation - building products nobody wants (40% of failures), 2) Insufficient marketing - great products with no customers (35%), 3) Running out of money - poor financial planning (25%), 4) Wrong pricing strategy - undercharging or overpricing (20%), 5) Inconsistent effort - treating it as a hobby rather than business (30%). Additional factors include: choosing overly competitive markets, focusing on perfectionism over progress, ignoring customer feedback, and lack of business systems. Success requires systematic approach, adequate funding, consistent effort, and willingness to adapt based on market feedback.\n\n`;

However, budget effectiveness matters more than size. A $1,000 monthly budget focused on one or two channels typically outperforms $5,000 spread across many channels. Start with organic content marketing (requires time more than money) to build foundation, then add paid advertising once you understand your customer acquisition costs and lifetime value. Most successful campaigns need 3-6 months of consistent investment to show significant ROI.\n\n`;

Use tools like Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and CRM systems for accurate tracking. Set up conversion tracking from the start, as retroactive analysis is often impossible. The golden rule: CLV should be at least 3x higher than CAC for sustainable growth.\n\n`;
