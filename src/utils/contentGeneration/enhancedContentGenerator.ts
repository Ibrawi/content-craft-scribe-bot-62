  return `Vitamin D is often called the "sunshine vitamin" because your skin produces it when exposed to sunlight. However, vitamin D is actually a hormone that plays crucial roles throughout your body.\n\n### How Vitamin D Works in Your Body\n\n**Step 1: Production or Intake**\nYour skin produces vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) when exposed to UVB radiation from sunlight. You can also get vitamin D from certain foods and supplements, though food sources are limited.\n\n**Step 2: Liver Processing**\nYour liver converts vitamin D into 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which is the form measured in blood tests. This is considered the storage form of vitamin D.\n\n**Step 3: Kidney Activation**\nYour kidneys convert 25(OH)D into the active hormone form called calcitriol [1,25(OH)2D]. This active form can then be used by your cells.\n\n**Step 4: Cellular Function**\nCalcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors found in nearly every cell in your body, influencing over 200 genes involved in:\n- Calcium and phosphorus absorption\n- Bone health and formation\n- Immune system function\n- Muscle strength and function\n- Mood regulation\n- Cell growth and development\n\n### Why Deficiency Occurs\n\nVitamin D deficiency can occur when any step in this process is disrupted, or when you don't get enough vitamin D from sun exposure, food, or supplements.`;

Here's what the numbers mean:\n\n- **Severe Deficiency:** <10 ng/mL (<25 nmol/L)\n- **Deficiency:** 10-20 ng/mL (25-50 nmol/L)\n- **Insufficiency:** 20-30 ng/mL (50-75 nmol/L)\n- **Adequate:** 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L)\n- **High:** 50-100 ng/mL (125-250 nmol/L)\n- **Potentially Toxic:** >100 ng/mL (>250 nmol/L)\n\nYour healthcare provider will interpret these results in the context of your symptoms and overall health.`;
